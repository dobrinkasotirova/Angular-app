      "description": "Porto has long been a hot destination for wine lovers - it's the go-to place to find the best of that sweet, tasty port wine. But this city by the sea has more to offer than vinho. Porto (or Oporto, as it's sometimes called) is an attractive European minimetropolis on Portugal's northwestern coast where visitors can get their fill of culture and the outdoors. Travelers can visit the city's wealth of museums, admire its varied architecture, relax in its verdant parks and, of course, hit the beach.",

      "description": "No one forgets the first glimpse of Venice. Whether arriving by plane, boat, train, or car, there is that startling moment when one looks across the waves and finds what should not be there - stone towers, rich churches, and packed buildings rising out of the sea. The extraordinary beauty of Venice only adds to its improbability. How does such a city exist?",

      "description": "From the 16th century until 1867, Luxembourg was one of Europe's greatest fortified sites, constantly reinforced as it passed through the hands of the Holy Roman Emperors, the House of Burgundy, the Hapsburgs, various French and Spanish kings and, eventually, the Prussians. Elements from all these eras are still in various gates, bastions, and forts and the old parts of the city have kept their original layout and public buildings.",

It is a dreamed-up city; a city almost completely faked; a city invented out of other cities, out of Paris by way of Vienna — the imitation, as Claudio Magris has it, of an imitation.",
